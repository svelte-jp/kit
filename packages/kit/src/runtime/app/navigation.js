 * @param {boolean} [opts.replaceState] If `true`, will replace the current `history` entry rather than creating a new one with `pushState`

 * To create a custom identifier, use a string beginning with `[a-z]+:` (e.g. `custom:state`) — this is a valid URL.
 *
 * The `function` argument can be used define a custom predicate. It receives the full `URL` and causes `load` to rerun if `true` is returned.

 * invalidate((url) => url.pathname === '/path');
